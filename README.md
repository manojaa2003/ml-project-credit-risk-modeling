Credit Risk Modelling
🔗 Live App:

👉 https://ml-project-credit-risk-modeling-manoj.streamlit.app/

A complete end-to-end Credit Risk Prediction System built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.
The system predicts default probability, generates a credit score (300–900), and provides a credit rating using a trained ML model.

This project simulates how real-world financial institutions evaluate borrower risk.
