Credit Risk Prediction Project

Credit Risk Modelling
🔗 Live App:

👉 https://ml-project-credit-risk-modeling-manoj.streamlit.app/

A complete end-to-end Credit Risk Prediction System built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.
The system predicts default probability, generates a credit score (300–900), and provides a credit rating using a trained ML model.

This project simulates how real-world financial institutions evaluate borrower risk.

# 🚀 Key Features

🔍 Predicts default probability using a trained ML model

📈 Generates a credit score (300–900)

🏷️ Classifies borrowers into Poor / Average / Good / Excellent

📊 Displays Loan-to-Income ratio

✨ Clean Streamlit UI for interactive usage

📦 Deployment-ready model artifact (model_data.joblib)

⚙️ Fully reproducible pipeline using preprocessing + scaling + one-hot encoding

🧠 Model Training Workflow

The credit risk model was trained using a structured and industry-aligned ML workflow.

# 1️⃣ Data Understanding & EDA

->Explored borrower demographics, loan attributes, credit behavior

->Analyzed delinquency indicators, loan purpose, income groups, risk patterns

->Checked missing values, outliers, skewness, and class imbalance

->Performed correlation and feature importance insights

# 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

->Missing value treatment using median/mode

->Outlier handling using IQR and percentile capping

->One-hot encoding for categorical variables

->Scaling of continuous variables using StandardScaler

# Feature engineering:

->Loan-to-Income Ratio

->Credit Utilization Ratio

->Delinquency Ratio

->DPD (Days Past Due) Metrics

Risk-based ratios derived from credit behavior

# 3️⃣ Train–Test Split

Used Stratified Split to preserve default distribution

Prevented data leakage by fitting scaler & encoder only on training data

# 4️⃣ Model Building & Comparison

## Multiple algorithms were evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Gradient Boosting

Metrics used:

AUC-ROC (primary metric)

Precision–Recall Curve

F1 Score

Brier Score (probability calibration)

# 5️⃣ Hyperparameter Optimization (Optuna)

Implemented Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization

Objective function optimized ROC-AUC

Tuned:

Number of estimators

Max depth

Learning rate

Regularization parameters

Achieved faster and more accurate tuning compared to manual grid/random search

# 6️⃣ Final Model Selection

Chose the best performing model based on AUC and calibration

Exported the following into model_data.joblib:

model

scaler

features

cols_to_scale

# 7️⃣ Credit Score Mapping

Default probability → Credit Score (300–900)

Default Probability	Credit Score	Rating
> 0.7	300–499	Poor
0.4–0.7	500–649	Average
0.2–0.4	650–749	Good
< 0.2	750–900	Excellent

This mapping mimics real credit bureau behavior.

# 8️⃣ Deployment Preparation
